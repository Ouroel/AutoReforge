Auto Reroll is a simple mod that adds an additional option on the goblin tinkerer to reroll automaticly as long as you have enough gold you don't need to spam reforge button any more.

Here it's how it works:

Melee Weapon -> Godly or Legendary
Range Weapon -> Unreal or Demonic
Magic Weapon -> Mythical or Demonic
Summoner Weapon -> Ruthless
Tools -> Light
Accesories -> Warding, Menacing or Lucky
